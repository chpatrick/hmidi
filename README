Installation & Usage
--------------------

It should install without problems on Mac OS X and Windows. 

As usual, just run the command:

cabal install 

or if you are very oldschool:

runghc Setup.lhs configure
runghc Setup.lhs build
runghc Setup.lhs install

When using the library, you *have* to link against the threaded runtime:

ghc --make -threaded -O monitor.hs

There are some example applications in the 'examples' directory.
